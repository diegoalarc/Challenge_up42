# *[UP42](https://up42.com/) Customer Support Challenge*

### Objective (why)
Our main role as customer support engineers is to make sure we understand the customer problem and we help in finding a solution to the problem.

This challenge aims to emphasize the following skills:
- [x] Problem solving and delivering an optimal solution in a limited timeframe.
- [x] Open communication with the customer.
- [x] Ability to persuade the customer.

### The challenge (what)
Our colleagues in Business Development have just closed a large deal with Bruno Brazil Associates, a well-established environmental consulting firm that consists of a multidisciplinary team (geotechnical engineers, geologists, biologists, agronomists, etc.).
Their current assignment is to evaluate the health of forests in [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_in_Bhutan). Additionally, the local monarch has asked Bruno Brazil Associates to provide the results in [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) (COG) format, so that local communities can access the results without overloading the network infrastructure of the country. Usually, they would send a team to do the assessment on the ground. However, due to both the high costs of sending a team to such a remote country and also due to CoVID travel restrictions, the consulting firm needs to find a way to investigate the country!s overall forest health without ground measurements, so they decided to contact UP42 and adopt remote sensing as their method of investigating forest health.

Example with [Sentinel-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2) satellite, which we use to analyze a sample of the Bhutan forest, and with which we will generate a simple [NDVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) analysis.
